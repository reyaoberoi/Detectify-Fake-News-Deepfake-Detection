# Detectify-Fake-News-Deepfake-Detection
Developed a dual-model web app to detect fake news using NLP and identify deepfake images using CNNs. Utilized TF-IDF with Logistic Regression for text classification and trained a Keras-based CNN on selected frames from the DeepFake Detection dataset. Built an interactive Gradio UI with real-time prediction and confidence scores.
